          This documentation page provides information about the $19 Fortnite card.
          The $19 Fortnite card is a prepaid card that can be used to purchase in-game currency (V-Bucks) in Fortnite, a popular online video game developed by Epic Games.
          With the $19 Fortnite card, players can enhance their gaming experience by purchasing various in-game items such as outfits, skins, emotes, and battle passes.
          To redeem the $19 Fortnite card, players need to visit the official Fortnite website or launch the Fortnite game client and navigate to the "Store" or "V-Bucks" section. They will then be prompted to enter the code found on the back of the card to add the funds to their account.
          It's important to note that the $19 Fortnite card can only be redeemed for V-Bucks in Fortnite and cannot be used for purchases in other games or platforms.

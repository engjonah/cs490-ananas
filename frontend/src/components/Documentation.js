        <h2>MERN</h2>
        <p>
          This documentation page provides basic information about the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
          The MERN stack is a popular web development stack used for building full-stack web applications.
          It consists of four main components:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>MongoDB:</strong> A NoSQL database used for storing application data.</li>
          <li><strong>Express.js:</strong> A web application framework for Node.js used for building server-side applications.</li>
          <li><strong>React.js:</strong> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code server-side.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Developers use the MERN stack for its flexibility, efficiency, and ease of learning. It enables rapid development of scalable and maintainable web applications.
          To get started with the MERN stack, developers typically set up a development environment, configure the necessary tools and dependencies, and begin building their application.
          Resources such as tutorials, documentation, and community forums are available to assist developers in learning and mastering the MERN stack.

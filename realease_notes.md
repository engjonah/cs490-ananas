# Ananas Code Translator  Release Notes
## April 2024 - Version 1.0

This is the first release of the code translation application by our team. We leverage OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo model to provide translation service for a variety of different programming languages.

## Supported Languages
- Python
-   Java
-   C++
-   Ruby
-   C#
-   JavaScript
-   Kotlin
-   Objective-C

## Limitations

Due to the free nature of the service, you may be limited in the amount of requests you can send within a short period of time. 

We rely largely on OpenAI's model to provide accurate translation, but incorporate complex prompts when querying translations.
> To promote accuracy, we also limit code length to 100 lines - larger workloads could result in less accurate results.

* Optimized frontend to be lightning fast
